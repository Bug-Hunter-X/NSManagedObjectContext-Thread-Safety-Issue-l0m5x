In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and its interaction with threads.  Specifically, if you attempt to perform operations on a managed object context from a thread other than the one it was created on, you'll encounter unexpected behavior or crashes. This can happen when working with background threads or Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).
