To fix this, always perform Core Data operations on the context's designated thread.  Use the `performBlock:` or `performBlockAndWait:` methods of `NSManagedObjectContext`.  `performBlock:` executes asynchronously, while `performBlockAndWait:` executes synchronously.  Example:

```objectivec
NSManagedObjectContext *context = //Your managed object context

// Correct usage
[context performBlock:^{ 
    //Perform your Core Data operations here. For example, saving changes
    NSError *error = nil;
    if (![context save:&error]) {
        NSLog(@"Error saving context: %@", error);
    }
}];

//Incorrect Usage
//This will most likely crash.
// [context save:&error];
```
By using these methods, you guarantee thread safety and prevent unexpected behavior related to Core Data operations.
